                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's address the elephant in the room‚Äîfinding a sublet as a student is like finding an internship‚Ä¶ a <span class="danger-text">nightmare</span>. I know this firsthand. I'm <span class="accent-text">Jonathan Manta</span>, a student at Tufts University and the founder of Squibber. The summer after my freshman year, I worked long days in concrete construction while trying to secure a sublet. I ended up on a sketchy website, paying just to contact homeowners and hoping for a response. That's when I realized there had to be a better, safer way.
                </p>
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                    My close friends know this about me‚ÄîI'm super <span class="danger-text">dyslexic</span>, have <span class="danger-text">ADHD</span>, and am <span class="danger-text">colorblind</span>. For me, things work differently, and I always look for the simplest way to solve problems. When designing Squibber, every feature and function was inspired by real personal experiences and challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I find visual instructions clearer than text, Squibber emphasizes quick, easy-to-follow videos over lengthy explanations. We've thoughtfully incorporated iconography into our listings to ensure clarity for users with diverse abilities. Additionally, we've paid close attention to UX decisions, including intuitive navigation and high-contrast colors to accommodate various visual needs. At Squibber, we believe accessible housing is just as important as accessibility for disabilities‚Äîit's about <span class="accent-text">inclusivity</span>, creating a community where everyone, no matter their ability, can easily use our services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After my summer shifts, I started coding the first version of Squibber‚Äîa platform designed to simplify and secure the leasing and subletting process. We launched a pilot at Tufts, and through word of mouth, we quickly grew to over <span class="accent-text">2,000 active users</span>.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Platform</h2>
                <p>
                    Squibber isn't just another subleasing listing site. We're building a community-driven platform that connects students directly, making it easier to find <span class="accent-text">reliable sublets</span>. Our dream is to have a platform that is easy to use and that all students, especially <span class="accent-text">international students students</span>, <span class="accent-text">economically disadvantaged students</span>, <span class="accent-text">first-gen students</span>, and <span class="accent-text">students with disabilities</span>, can benefit from.
